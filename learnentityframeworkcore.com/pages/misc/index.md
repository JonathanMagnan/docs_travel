# EF Core Misc

EF Core is an open-source, lightweight, cross-platform, and extensible version of Entity Framework to interact with relational databases. It is highly customizable and can be extended by writing custom code or by using third-party extensions. It has a simple attribute-based system for mapping data between a database and a .NET object, as well as support for asynchronous operations and bulk insert and update operations. Its simplicity, speed, and flexibility make it a popular choice among developers looking for an efficient way to work with data in their .NET applications.
