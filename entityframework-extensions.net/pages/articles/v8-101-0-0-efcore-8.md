# EF Extensions for EF Core 8 - What is New?

[EF Core 8](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/releases/tag/v7.0.0) was finally released on November 14 2023, along with some new features, bug fixes, and breaking changes. Every new major EF Core version brings some new challenges for our Entity Framework Library and [Bulk Extensions](https://entityframework-extensions.net/bulk-extensions) methods to always become faster, use less memory, and be extensible than our previous version. This time, one of our biggest challenges was the introduction of [Complex Type](https://www.learnentityframeworkcore.com/model/complex-type), which our library already fully supports.

You can download Entity Framework Extensions for all EF Core versions here: [Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore/)

## EF Core Pinned Version Increased

EF Extensions follow a [EFCore-Pinned Versioning](https://entityframework-extensions.net/efcore-pinned-versioning) convention `[efcore-version].[major].[minor].[patch]`.

So with EF Core 8 now officially released, this means that for [Entity Framework Extensions](https://entityframework-extensions.net/) and [Entity Framework Plus](https://entityframework-plus.net/):

- Release notes will now use the format `8.x.y.z` instead of `7.x.y.z`.
- [EF Extensions for EF6](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Z.EntityFramework.Extensions/) (usually used for .NET Framework) will also adopt the new format `8.x.y.z` to maintain consistency with EF Core versioning.

_The `8` corresponds to the highest EF Core version available_

### Bulk Insert with Complex Type

EF Core 8 added the long waiting [complex type](https://www.learnentityframeworkcore.com/model/complex-type) previously available from EF 6. We are happy to announce that our [Bulk Insert](https://entityframework-extensions.net/bulk-insert) and most other bulk methods already support complex and nested complex types.

Bulk inserting an entity with a complex type doesn't require any additional setup on your side. You simply use the `BulkInsert` method as you usually do:

```csharp
zzz
```

You can learn more about complex types on Learn EF Core:

- [EF Core Complex Type](https://www.learnentityframeworkcore.com/model/complex-type)
- [EF Core Complex Type Attribute](https://www.learnentityframeworkcore.com/configuration/data-annotation-attributes/complextype-attribute)
- [EF Core Complex Property Method](https://www.learnentityframeworkcore.com/configuration/fluent-api/complexproperty-method)

### Bulk Insert with BulkOperationOptions

Passing bulk operation options is now available by passing a [BulkOperationOptions](bulk-options#bulkoperationoptions).

In previous versions of Entity Framework Extensions, you were able to pass options only through our [Fluent API](bulk-ptions#fluent-api-options), such as:

```csharp
zzz
```

However, starting from `v8.101.0.0`, you can now also pass options by creating a new instance of the `BulkOperationOptions` class and passing it to any of our methods, such as:

```csharp
zzz
```

We will now support both techniques, so you can use whatever you prefer.

### Bulk Insert with IncludeGraph - Faster & Lighter

In 2023, we mainly focused to improve our bulk method. We made a lot of improvement to our [Include Graph](https://entityframework-extensions.net/include-graph) options to make sure it's faster and lighter and so far, all we can say is this has been a success.

As you can see in our [IncludeGraph - Breacking Changes](https://entityframework-extensions.net/v7-100-0-0-include-graph#memory-performance-improvements) article, the new `IncludeGraph` option can be **5 times faster** and comsume around only **20% of the memory** compared to its predecessor that you can still access with the `LegacyIncludeGraph` option.

```csharp
zzz
```

## Conclusion

In conclusion, upgrading to EF Core 8 presents its challenges, but with our Entity Framework Extensions fully supporting it, and we encourage you to test it.

Our primary objective in 2023 was to enhance performance and reduce memory consumption, and we are proud of the improvements we have made. Looking ahead to 2024, our team is already preparing to support the first alpha release of EF Core 9. We will dedicate more times to improve our documentation and introducing new features, both free and premium, to provide further flexibily to developers.
